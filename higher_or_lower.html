					Higher or Lower is a guessing game, 
					where you fil in a number, 
					it takes that number and creates a random number in between the number you filled in and 1. 
					Then you can start guessing. 
					With each guess it tells you if the random number is higher or lower than the number you guessed.

			<h1>How and when was the game created?</h1>
			<br>
			<h2>
				The game was created on the 9th of November in 2023. 
				It was made in a couple hours. 
				With all the knowledge I had from my first couple game design lessons. 
				The day I created the game I had just got my 3dt lesson. 
				So, itâ€™s a simple script with only 40 lines of code made in C#. 
				When I get better, I am surely going to make the script better or make a new one.
